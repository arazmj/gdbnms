The goal of this project is to review graph databases for network management systems applications, a graph database is a database that uses graph structures for semantic queries with nodes, edges and properties to represent and store data. The relationships allow data in the store to be linked together directly, and in many cases retrieved with one operation. Graph databases hold the relationships between data as a priority. Querying relationships within a graph database is fast because they are perpetually stored within the database itself. Relationships can be intuitively visualized using graph databases, making it useful for network management systems working heavily inter-connected network data.

The purpose for this review is find the best graph database technology and the supporting case scenarios to use the database to store and retrieve network topology.
